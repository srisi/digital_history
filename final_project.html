                <h1>Final Group Project</h1>

                <p>For the final project, you will work in groups of three or four to explore a
                    dataset with about 1000 to 4000
                    data points and turn your findings into a public history project, hosted
                    on your own project websites.
                    These datasets include, for example,
                    <a href="http://tobacco.stanford.edu/tobacco_main/index.php">
                        Cigarette advertisements
                    </a>,
                    <a href="https://www.deadiversion.usdoj.gov/arcos/retail_drug_summary/">
                        Opioid prescription data
                    </a>,
                    <a href="https://www.erowid.org/">
                        Experience reports from people who take drugs
                    </a>, or
                    <a href="https://github.com/social-machines/RadioTalk">radio show
                    transcripts</a>.
                </p>

                <p>Each project website needs to include:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>A narrative of about 2000 words that describes your research and
                        findings</li>
                    <li>At least five visualizations that explore clearly defined questions</li>
                    <li>An “About” page that describes the sources, processing, and presentation
                        that went into the project as well as your explanations for choices that
                        you make. The “About” page should also include short bios of the team
                        members and outline who work on what aspect of the project.</li>
                    <li>An annotated bibliography of the literature and projects consulted</li>
                    <li>A data critique that explains what information is included in your dataset
                        and what questions it can and cannot answer.</li>
                </ul>

                <h2>Datasets</h2>
                <p>Here are datasets that you could consider working with:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>
                        <a href="https://pushshift.io/">Reddit Corpora</a>: This is a great site
                        that gives you access to Reddit submissions in a very flexible way.
                        For example, you could get comments from
                        <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Drugs/">r/Drugs</a>. Or you could get
                        a sample of comments mentioning Fentanyl from 2015 through 2020 and compare
                        them. Or you could get samples from different areas (r/Kentucky vs.
                        r/Boston) and see what patterns you can identify.
