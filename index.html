                </h1>
                <p></p>
                <p>Welcome!</p>
                <p>
                    In this class, you will learn how to use digital techniques in your historical research.
                    We will cover how to analyze datasets, how to create interactive maps and visualizations, and how to set up your own website to present your findings.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Our discussions will be grounded in the history of drugs in the United States from alcohol prohibition to algorithmic bias in today’s drug courts,
                    which we will explore using news reports, digital projects, and video games.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Throughout the semester, you will work on a collaborative final project for which
                    you will  analyze a dataset with thousands of sources and use it to develop your
                    own research questions. Maybe you want to investigate prescription data behind the
                    current opioid epidemic, or you might want to explore gender representations in
                    cigarette advertisements. There are many exciting datasets for us to work with.
                </p>
                <p>Check back in mid-December to find a complete syllabus on this site.</p>

                    <li>Use quantitative data for historical research</li>
                    <li>Critique and clean datasets</li>
                    <li>Perform basic text analysis</li>
                    <li>Create interative visualizations</li>
                    <li>Use mapping tools</li>
                    <li>Host projects on your own website</li>
                </ul>

                <h2>Target Audience</h2>
                <p>
                    This class is designed for undergraduate and graduate students interested in
                    working with data regardless of your skill level. If you have never programmed
                    before, you will learn important basics and if you’re a course 6 major, we will
                    find many ways to challenge you with complex real-world datasets.
