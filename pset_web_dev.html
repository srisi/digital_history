                <h1>Web Development Assignment</h1>

                <p>Due: Sunday, 2/16, 11.59pm</p>


                <p>For this assignment, you will set up your own course website while
                    investigating the effects of one substance in depth,
                drawing both on the reports of individual users and aggregated information.
                </p>

                <h2>Step 1: Set up your website</h2>
                <p>Use this <a href="https://github.com/srisi/github_pages_tutorial">tutorial</a>
                to set up your own website for the class. This will be the lab activity on 2/12.</p>


                <h2>Step 2: Investigate a Drug</h2>

                <p><a href="https://www.erowid.org/splash.php">Erowid</a> is a fantastic starting
                    point to explore the effects, both good and bad, that individual substance
                    have. For this assigment, you should dive into the user reports for one of the
                    following drugs:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li><a href="https://erowid.org/chemicals/cocaine/">Cocaine</a> (Stimulant)</li>
                    <li><a href="https://erowid.org/chemicals/dmt/">DMT</a> (Psychedelic)</li>
                    <li><a href="https://www.erowid.org/chemicals/dxm/">DXM</a> (Dissociative) See
                    also: <a href="https://www.erowid.org/chemicals/dxm/faq/dxm_faq.shtml">DXM FAQ</a></li>
                    <li><a href="https://www.erowid.org/chemicals/ketamine/">Ketamine</a> (Dissociative)</li>
                    <li><a href="https://www.erowid.org/chemicals/lsd/">LSD</a> (Psychedelic)</li>
                </ul>
                <p>You can find the experience reports by scrolling down to the "Experiences" section.
                </p>
                <p>Once you have a sense of how people experience the effects of this particular
                drug, investigate the same substance on
                    <a href="https://calib.ro/pronoia/">Visualizing Erowid</a>. What new information
                do you learn by looking not at one but hundreds of reports in an aggregated form?
                But also, what do you lose?</p>

                <h2>Step 3: Write a blog post</h2>
                <p>Once you are done with your investigation, write a 500-600 word blog post, which
                summarizes: </p>
                <ul>
                    <li>What is it like to take the substance that you have explored? Are there any
                    common misconceptions?</li>
                    <li>What have you gained from exploring the same substance on Visualizing
                    Erowid? And what got lost in their summary?</li>
                </ul>
                <p>The goal of this assignment is not just to make you familiar with a substance
                    but also to make you comfortable with web development. Here are the technical
                    requirements for this assignment:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Set up a new page to host this assignment entitled pset_web_dev.html</li>
                    <li>Add your blogpost to the navigation bar at the top of the page</li>
                    <li>Include at least 3 links</li>
                    <li>Include at least 1 image</li>
                    <li>Send me a link to your new website</li>
                </ul>
