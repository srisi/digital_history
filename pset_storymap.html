                <p>Due: Sunday, 3/1, 11.59pm</p>


                <p>For this assignment, you will use <a href="https://storymap.knightlab.com/">
                    StoryMap.js</a> to tell a spatial story about the movement of people or
                    substances across the United States or the world. Storymap gives you a point and
                    click interface to create these stories and embed them into your website.
                </p>


                <h2>Step 1: Look at Examples</h2>
                <p>First, have a look at some of the <a href="https://storymap.knightlab.com/#examples">
                    examples</a> to get a sense of the kinds of stories that you can tell.</p>
                <p>Note that Storymap can be used to tell stories using both maps and images, for
                example <a href="https://storymap.knightlab.com/examples/bosch-garden/">
                        Hieronymus Bosch's Garden of Earthly Delights.</a>
                Using images, so called Gigapixels, is a bit too complicated for this tutorial
                    but keep in mind that it is a possibility for the final project. Crystal has
                    written a <a href="https://github.com/crystaljjlee/histsci-119/#making-the-storymaps">
                        great tutorial</a> on how to create them.
                </p>

                <h2>Step 2: Watch Crystal's Tutorial</h2>
                <p>Crystal has recorded a <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wZjAc8_VOaY&feature=youtu.be">
                    short tutorial</a> on how to use Storymap. Have a look!</p>

                <h2>Step 3: Create a 15 minute prototype</h2>
                <p>Spend about 15 minutes playing around with Storymap. Add slides! Add images!
                Change the background! Change the map used!
                </p>
                <p>You don't need to tell a story yet, just familiarize yourself with the functions
                that Storymap provides.</p>

                <h2>Step 3.5 (Optional): Use a custom map</h2>
                <p>Storymap allows you to integrate a wide range of maps. <a href="http://mapwarper.net/">
                    Map Warper</a> has a large collection of geocoded maps that are ready to be imported.
                </p>
                <p>Let's say we want to work with this <a href="http://mapwarper.net/maps/40766">
                    map of the successes of the suffrage movement from 1919.</a>
                    To import this map:
                </p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Click on the <a href="http://mapwarper.net/maps/40766#Export_tab">Export</a> tab.
                    Then find the "Tiles (Google/OSM scheme)" attribute and copy its contents, i.e.
                    <code>http://mapwarper.net/maps/tile/40766/{z}/{x}/{y}.png</code>
                    </li>
                    <li>In Storymap, click "Options in the top left.</li>
                    <li>In the dialogue field, select "custom" as the "Map Type," which will show
                        more configuration options.</li>
                    <li>Copy <code>http://mapwarper.net/maps/tile/40766/{z}/{x}/{y}.png</code> into the
                        URL field and then close the menu.</li>
                </ul>
                <p>This should load your custom map. If you cannot see anything, you might either
                be too far zoomed in or look at the wrong location. For example, if you have selected
                a map of DC, the map will only be visible when you are actually looking at DC.</p>

                <h2>Step 4: Deploy your prototype to your website</h2>

                <p>On the storymap website, click the "Share" button on the top right.</p>
                <p>Scroll down and find the "Embed" code. It will look something like this:</p>
                <p><code>&ltiframe src="https://uploads.knightlab.com/storymapjs/c6110d70c3383cc90ae51583a6d15d0e/test/index.html"
                                 frameborder="0" width="100%" height="800"&gt&lt/iframe&gt</code></p>
                <p>An <code>iframe</code> is essentially a website within a website, i.e. your
                    browser will first load your website and then load whatever is in the iframe,
                in this case your Storymap.</p>
                <p>To get your storymap up and running, your html code should look like this:</p>
                <img src="images/tutorials/storymap_html.png" alt="Screenshot of html layout to
                    host storymap.">


                <h2>Step 5: Research a Story</h2>

                <h4>Option 1: Create a Storymap around the story of <a href="https://twitter.com/joshclarkdavis/status/1068889697999568897?lang=en">
                    Keith Jackson</a>, who was framed by the DEA to set up a crack deal near the
                    White House.
                </h4>
                <p>Additional Readings</p>
                <ul>
                    <li><a href="https://pointsadhs.com/2016/03/31/keithjacksonmatters-the-kid-that-sold-crack-to-the-president/#more-13876">
                        Melanie Durfee, "#KEITHJACKSONMATTERS: The Kid That Sold Crack To The President"
                    </a></li>
                    <li><a href="https://41s-readings.s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/New_Jim_crow.pdf">

                        Age of Colorblindness</i>, Routledge, 2010, Ch. 2.</a></li>
                </ul>

                <h4>Option 2: Follow the flow of Fentanyl into the United States</h4>
                <p>How does fentanyl come to the United States? Where is it produced? How does it
                get distributed?</p>
                <p>Additional Readings</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>
                        <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/investigations/2019/08/23/fentanyl-flowed-through-us-postal-service-vehicles-crossing-southern-border">
                            Sari Horwitz and Scott Higham, "The flow of fentanyl: In the mail, over the border."
                        </a>
                    </li>

                            Kristina Davis and Sandra Dibble, "Fentanyl has taken over America's drug market. Where
                            is it coming from?"
                        </a>
                    </li>
                </ul>

                <h4>Option 3: Choose your own adventure</h4>
                <p>Already know a story--whether related to the history of drugs or not--that you want
                to tell with a storymap? Let me know!</p>

                <p>In each case, make sure to find and reference at least one additional newspaper
                or academic journal article that you have traced down yourself.</p>


                <h2>Step 6: Create your Storymap</h2>
                <p>Once you have done your research, think about how you want to tell your story.
                How do you want to follow a person or a substance? What do you want to reader to
                    take away? What images do you want to use?
                </p>
                <p>Then, create a storymap with:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>At least 10 slides with titles and text</li>
                    <li>At least 5 of those slides should feature images</li>
                </ul>
                <p>Finally, host your storymap on pset_storymap.html and send me a link by Sunday
                night.</p>
